# Algorithm Visualizer

A Windows Forms application that visualizes sorting algorithms in real-time. The project demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by showing step-by-step animations of the sorting process.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
- Support for multiple sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
- Step-by-step animation with detailed state information
- Adjustable animation speed
- Visual indicators for active and swapped elements
- Performance metrics (comparisons, swaps, execution time)

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Windows OS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Algorithm-Visualizer
```

3. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

## Running the Application

1. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run --project Visualization
```

2. Use the interface to:
   - Select a sorting algorithm
   - Input array size and values
   - Control animation with play/pause/step buttons
   - Adjust animation speed
